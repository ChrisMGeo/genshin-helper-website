    "notes": "DPS\nAmber DPS will be focused on maximizing Charged Shot damage on enemy weak spots as Amber's Ascension 4 Talent increases ATK by 15% for 10s after hitting a weak spot. Crit is also guaranteed when you land your shot on a weak spot so we aim to maximize Crit DMG with little to no dependance on Crit Rate, this could change after [C4].\nAfter [C4], the playstyle catering towards her Skill damage becomes available, with this build you will want to run Crimson Witch of Flames (4) while trying to maintain the 1:2 Crit Ratio for more frequent nukes. This playstyle is safer, more consistent and has more AoE damage to play compared to Charge Shot Amber.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nShimenawa's Reminiscence: At [C4] this set will beat out Wanderer's Troupe for Amber Charged Shot Main DPS.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nPrototype Crescent: This bow will beat Skyward Harp if it's [R2+].\nHamayumi: This bow will beat Sharpshooter's Oath [R5] if it's [R2+].\n\nSUPPORT\nDue to her poor scalings, this section is dedicated to a low-investment build that provides utility and shieldbreaking capabilities by abusing her quick Pyro application on her Elemental Burst. Due to her energy generation being extremely poor, her Energy Recharge options are prioritized.\n\nRegarding Instructors (4): This set is preferred over Noblesse Oblige (4) when Amber is used as support in a Hu Tao vaporize team.\n",

This allows you to distribute ER rolls into otherwise offensive substats and due to this, an [R5] Kitain Cross Spear can outperform Primordial Jade-Winged Spear.

Note that it is not recommended to stay on this build as Xiangling can still contribute respectable damage with offensive stats.\n\nPHYSICAL DPS\nIt is not recommended to run Physical DPS Xiangling since Xiangling excels more as an Off-field Pyro DPS. Physical Xiangling is only good for early game.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nCrescent Pike: Crescent Pike is extremely strong on Xiangling due to the nature of her attack combo, Crescent Pike continues to surpass Primordial Jade Winged-Spear in terms of Normal/Charge Attack Damage.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nPale Flame (4): The passive from this set can have 100% uptime through using Guoba off cooldown.\n",

The combo for the highest Melt/Vaporize damage is The Black Sword and EM sand. [R1] Iron Sting and EM sand turns out to have diminishing returns and isn't as good, but [R2+] Iron Sting is a different question because better buffs. (Assuming you don't have a whale build's CR/CD stats, in which case Aquila with EM sands is just flat out better.)\n\nThundering Fury (4): This set works best if paired with Electro supports such as Beidou and Fischl/Lisa, as it allows Bennett to accomplish 2 things: \n1) Rapidly spam E for raw pyro damage + overload\n2) Generate tons of energy for the entire team. \nThundering Fury (4) also allows Bennett to quickly break the shields of the Abyss Lectors in the Spiral Abyss. This comp is generally only recommended for those with Beidou on C2/C6.\nIt's worth noting that the main-stat artifacts you want to farm for 4-TF Bennett varies from the main-stat artifacts you'd normally go for in other builds. Instead of ATK/EM, Pyro, and Crit, you'd instead want to go for EM/Pyro/EM on a 4-TF Bennett. As such, this also means weapons that have EM substats such as Iron sting take priority over other swords. \n\nIt is also worth noting that with 4 TF, Primordial Jade Cutter is able to overtake MIstsplitter Reforged due to its massive Crit Rate% substat, which allows you to vape consistently despite the lack of Crit Dmg/Crit Rate subs in your artifacts. This assumes that your EM mainstat pieces (sands, goblet, and circlet) lack Crit Rate substats. However, in the rare occasion that your EM pieces manage to roll plenty of Crit subs, Mistsplitter easily overtakes Jade Cutter.\nRecommended amount of ER%: 130-150%. Worth noting that with Thundering Fury (4), you have a lot more leeway when it comes to ER.\n\nBURST SUPPORT\nA Burst Support Bennett completely ignores the need for excess healing potential and is aimed for people who prefer to squeeze out more damage instead. \nOn this build, Bennett is built with offensive stats like ATK%, Pyro Damage, and Crit stats while having a good amount of Energy Recharge to burst off cooldown. \nPrioritize Energy Recharge before offensive stats if you cannot cast your Elemental Burst off cooldown.\n\nSUPPORT\nHeals from his Elemental Burst scale off of HP, while his damage buff from Burst only scales with your base ATK (Character Base ATK stat and Weapon Base ATK stat)\nDO NOT increase Bennett's constellation from 5 to 6 unless he is in a Pyro team and you know what you're doing. This is because Bennett turns all of your melee on-field character's Auto Attacks into Pyro, which means that Bennett will lose a lot of his team comp potential.\nAlthough Bennett is usually considered a healer, he already heals a lot even without necessarily building for HP%, if you find it unnecessary to build for HP%, you can consider building him as a Sub DPS.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nMistsplitter Reforged, Aquila Favonia: These weapons have the highest Base ATK in the game which is why it is ranked quite high. It is assuming you have enough Energy Recharge so you still can burst off cooldown for the maximum ATK buff.\nFreedom-Sworn: In comps where Bennett can reliably trigger reactions (and thus trigger this sword's passive), the buffs provided by this weapon will be stronger than Aquila Favonia.\nThe Alley Flash: This weapon currently has the highest Base ATK for a 4 star weapon (even more Base ATK than some 5 stars like Skyward Blade).\nPrototype Rancour: This weapon has one of the highest Base ATK for a 4 Star weapon (and this is also a weapon you could craft from the Blacksmith)\n",

If you want to use her as a Physical Support, she needs both her Ascension 4 Talent and [C4] to maximize her support capabilities, making her a somewhat expensive choice to be considered for Physical Support role. However, the Tenacity of the Millelith set gives her a new role with a lower Constellation level prerequisite.\n\nTenacity of the Millelith: This set gives Xinyan a unique role among the shielders. Currently, Xinyan is one of the few shielders in the game who can make full use of the Tenacity set's effects. If you can maximize the uptime of Xinyan's Level 3 shield, she can provide a constant 30% Shield Strength and 20% Atk boost to the team (as long as the pulses hit an enemy). This means that Sacrificial Greatsword and Xinyan's [C2] are crucial to making this set shine on her. This set isn't as recommended for her if you have neither of the two.\n\nShield uptime is also crucial to maximizing her Physical/Shield Support capabilities. If you have neither Sacrificial Greatsword nor at least [C2] (but ideally [C4]) on Xinyan, you may want to build her as a Burst Support instead of Physical/Shield Support.\nAt [C2], her burst \"Riff Revolution\" has a 100% Crit Rate, which means you can build solely Crit Dmg (instead of trying to get a 1:2 Crit Rate:Crit DMG ratio) if you're building her as a Physical Burst support.\nGenerally not recommended for Pyro Applications, as the pulses only happen at Shield Level 3, and are not very efficient at breaking Cryo shields.\n",

When running a Vaporize team with Xingqiu, 3 normal attacks into a charged attack (N1>N2>N3>C) is the safest and most reliable way to vaporize your charged attacks. Make sure you're adding applying hydro first before starting combos.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nLost Prayer to the Sacred Winds: Bennett buff/ Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) will push Lost Prayer ahead of Skyward Atlas and Memory of Dust.\nKagura's Verity: Do note that with Bennett's Buff / Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4), Kagura's Verity will push ahead of Skyward Atlas and Memory of Dust. \nThe Widsith: Note that with strong attack buffs like Bennett's Burst, an [R5] Widsith can outperform most [R1] 5-star weapons, with the exception of Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds.\nDodoco Tales: On equal refinements, Widsith is better than Dodoco Tales, but assuming it's [R5] Dodoco Tales vs [R1]-[R3] Widsith, [R5] Dodoco Tales is better. Note that Bennett buff / Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) buff may push Widsith and Solar Pearl above Dodoco Tales, even at low refinements.\n\nRegarding Artifact Set:\nShimenawa's Reminiscence (4): Yanfei will rarely have her burst up due to the 15 energy cost on the 4-piece effect, however she can instead maintain the 4-piece DMG buff over a longer duration, making this set a good alternative to the other options. Note that this set loses out on some value at higher constellations, as she can't get her [C4] effects without casting Burst.\nRetracing Bolide (4): Running Yanfei with a shield character also allows you to make use of a full Retracing Bolide 4-set as a placeholder until you're able to find a good Crimson Witch 4-set. \n\nRegarding Artifact Substats Priority: \nEnergy Recharge is prioritized over Elemental Mastery here since she has an 80 energy burst cost while her skill is also not very efficient at generating particles for getting it back. A major source of your energy will be coming from enemies as well as potential pyro batteries like Bennett, so be sure to have her pick the particles up as off-field characters only get 0.6x the value of the particles.\n\nSHIELD SUPPORT\nThis section is dedicated to a playstyle where Yanfei is utilised as a primary shielder through her 4th Constellation.

If you find yourself being hit often, a low-stacked Serpent Spine will find itself falling significantly in potential. This weapon scales well with refinements, having the potential to be Diluc's best weapon.\nThe Unforged: This weapon matches Wolf's Gravestone while shielded.

This weapon scales well with refinements, potentially surpassing Wolf's Gravestone at [R5].\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nCrimson Witch of Flames (4): Generally the best go to set for Diluc due to how easily Diluc can stack the Pyro Damage effect, while his burst imbues his Normal/Charged Attacks with Pyro.\nGladiator's Finale (4):  For those who are still reluctant on farming for Crimson Witch of Flames (Pre-AR 45), this will still provide a fairly decent increase in DPS as a large portion of his damage is tied into his Normal Attack talent.\n\nRegarding Main Stats Priority:\nIf Diluc is run alongside Xingqiu where he can trigger vaporize very often, he can run EM sands as an alternative to ATK sands as EM boosts Diluc's reaction damage significantly.\n",

If in a situation where Klee is played with a shielder anyway, this weapon would be on par with Skyward Atlas.\nSolar Pearl: When using Solar Pearl, it is recommended to animation cancel a Normal Attack into an Elemental Skill and cancel that into her Elemental Burst at the start of her field time.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nLavawalker (4): Klee's kit makes it harder to utilize Vaporize and Melt the same way another pyro carry would, but her constant pyro application makes Lavawalkers a viable set. See KleefulFrame's great number breakdown here.\nCrimson Witch of Flames (4): This set is only recommended in a team where Klee is able to trigger Vaporize consistently.\nWanderer's Troupe (4): Wanderer's Troupe increases the Charged Attack by another 35% Damage Bonus.

Freeze Melt refers to freezing enemies for Melt set up, since unlike Diluc or Klee, Hu Tao doesn't shatter frozen enemies.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nPrimordial Jade Winged-Spear: Is better than the [R1] variants of Dragon's Bane and Deathmatch with ideal stacking. While this is a very strong weapon when fully stacked, maintaining the stacks on Hu Tao isn't ideal in realistic situations making the weapon less consistent than other options.\nDeathmatch: Deathmatch is better than Dragon's Bane when you're not doing Vaporize.\nBlackcliff Pole: Despite seeming quite good due to the Crit DMG substat, Blackcliff at 1 stack performs only slightly better than an [R5] White Tassel in practice as it is difficult to maintain stacks consistently. It is not recommended to buy this weapon specifically for Hu Tao and should only be used if you already have one.\nVortex Vanquisher and Skyward Spine: Provides little to nothing to Hu Tao since she scales better with HP% than ATK% with every spear in the game. Base ATK makes little difference on Hu Tao because she has a very high HP to ATK conversion cap.\nWhite Tassel: White Tassel requires your combos to be more focused on Normal Attacks (N2C over N1C) to make use of it's passive.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets: \nShimenawa's Reminiscence (4): Provides higher AA damage than 4CW but lowers your Elemental Burst damage which hurts your AoE damage, also if you're unable to burst, it might cause survivability issues if you're not running a healer.\nRetracing Bolide (4) and Wanderer's Troupe / Tenacity of the Millelith (2) + Crimson's Witch of Flame (2): All these options are almost on equal footing because both of the sets have an equal overall damage output assuming you have 100% shield uptime when using Bolide (4). The difference is, you want to use 2/2 WT/CW when focusing on Nuking and better consistency, while 4 Bolide is for overall higher AA damage at the expense of lower burst damage, although inconsistent if you cannot keep your shield permanently.\n\nRegarding Artifact Substats Priority: \nSince Hu Tao is able to trigger Vaporize on most of her damage output, Elemental Mastery is quite valuable on her. If you have less than 100EM total (including from Sucrose EM share, 4pc Instructor, etc) EM substat take priority over Crit Rate / DMG.\n",

When at 3 stacks, this weapon can be close to Slingshot [R5]. Use it if it's already built for another character and you don't want to invest in Slingshot just for Yoimiya.\n\nRegarding Artifacts:  \nShimenawa's Reminiscence (4): This set is her Best in Slot in the vast majority of situations even when considering inconsistent Burst usage (once every 3-4 rotations).\nCrimson Witch of Flames (2) +18% ATK set (2): While lacking in power compared to the other options, you will likely have good substats on the 2 piece combinations compared to a full 4 piece set which can compensate.\nCrimson Witch of Flames (4): Usable in Vaporise teams and can be her Best in Slot for teams where she procs Vaporise and Overload (such as teams with a Fischl flex or Fischl + Beidou taser core)\nEchoes of an Offering (4): This set has a lot of caveats that generally warrant it being a subpar choice. Its effects proccing is tied to your connection to the servers, so if your ping is above 100 and/or you have an unstable connection (fluctuations), you should avoid this set. Additionally, the RNG nature of its procs makes it unreliable in Vaporise teams as you can't guarantee it working on N1, N3 and N5 (her vaporised hits). \n\nRegarding Mainstats:\nElemental Mastery: A good option if Yoimiya is triggering Vaporise and/or Overload. Having Bennett in the team favours Elemental Mastery sands slightly more than ATK sands, however it is recommended to just use whichever has better substats.\n\nRegarding Talent Priorities: \nHer Skill has poor scaling which results in individual upgrades not affecting your damage much. Her Burst is also low priority due to it being used once every few rotations in some scenarios (such as when using Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4) without an abundance of off field energy) which can reduce its effectiveness. \n",

Hopefully, by the time your second/third round of Oz summoning is over, you'll have gained enough energy to repeat the loop.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices: \nIn general, Fischl's rankings depend significantly on the refinements of her weapons. For more detailed numbers, see the Google Sheet here.\nAlley Hunter: At [R5] this weapon can be similar in performance to Skyward Harp and Thundering Pulse.\nThe Stringless: At [R5] this weapon can be stronger than Amos Bow / Alley Hunter [R1] / The Viridescent Hunt. This difference is enlarged in teams where Fischl can find herself triggering reactions.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nThundersoother (4): This artifact set will outperform Gladiator's Finale(2) Thundering Fury(2) if used in a team comp where an electro aura is always present (e.g. Electro/Electro-charged comps) therefore it is highly recommended within this niche.\nTenacity of the Millelith (4): This set trades off a portion of Fischl's damage in return for a party wide 20% ATK buff. If you have good pieces as a result of farming Pale Flame (for Eula or otherwise) this can be a good option for her in specific teams. Fischl can benefit from the 20% ATK buff herself if she summons Oz within 3 seconds of his previous attack. Not recommended to specifically farm this set for Fischl. \n",

    "notes": "OFF-FIELD DPS\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nSerpent Spine: This weapon can be considered over Wolf's Gravestone for a Sub DPS Beidou, while Wolf's Gravestone is equipped onto another Claymore DPS character with higher field time. Beidou can effectively make use of the full stacks, as long as you have her stacks up before swapped away, the stacks will be maintained even while off-field since her Elemental Burst snapshots her stats. Serpent Spine outperforms Wolf's Gravestone by a significant margin when Bennett/Sara ATK buffs are applied.\nRedhorn Stonethresher: Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.\nAkuoumaru (260 team energy assumed): Akuoumaru outperforms Skyward Pride on a low ER requirement Beidou (where she is paired with other Electro characters to battery her energy needs). At [R3+], it becomes exponentially better and comes very close to Serpent Spine and Wolf's Gravestone. \n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nEmblem of Severed Fate (4): Even after considering the 4-piece set effect, you should refrain from investing into Energy Recharge beyond what is needed to burst off cooldown as it will result in a damage loss as compared to prioritising offensive stats such as ATK/Crit. In team comps where Beidou has low ER requirements (i.e. when paired with electro batteries), a Noblesse Oblige (2) / Thundering Fury (2) / +18% ATK set (2) [Choose Two] will outperform Emblem of Severed Fate (4).\nThundersoother (4): This set works best in an Electro-Charged or mono Electro comps.\nNoblesse Oblige (4): This set could be considered if the team doesn't have a Noblesse Oblige (4) user, do note that sometimes Beidou doesn't benefit from the ATK buff from the 4 piece set if she's the set holder, so Beidou as a Noblesse Oblige (4) holder isn't really recommended.\nScholar (2) The Exile (2): This set acts as a cheap beginner's option to provide Beidou with 40% Energy Recharge to help maintain her Elemental Burst uptime.\n",

You can still have an Overload team with an Electro DPS Lisa, however, if the situation prefers it.\n\nRegarding Weapons:\nKagura's Verity: Kagura's ranking at the top is based on executing the specific rotation of Tap E > N2 > Tap E > N2 > Tap E > Q > N1 > Hold E > N1 > CA > N3 > N2 > CA for max stacks. For more details please see the weapon calculations here.\n\nEM DPS\nEM Lisa DPS aims to be the consistent trigger for reactions, Overload is generally the best reaction for this set up. Avoid having a second Electro in the team for this build since this could mess up the Pyro aura Lisa wants for this playstyle. \n\nElectro-Charge teams will have a hard time trying to utilize EM DPS Lisa, in these situations, build Electro DPS or Off-Field DPS Lisa instead.\n\nRegarding Stats Priority: Try to invest both into EM and ER. The goal is to try stack as much EM while getting enough ER (170-190%) for a comfortable Burst uptime depending on your teams.\n\nOFF-FIELD DPS\nCan be built to set up for either Burst damage or Quickswap Skill Nuke damage.\nLisa works well with anemo characters which can keep enemies in her ultimate radius.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choice:\nKagura's Verity: Similar to the above mentioning, this weapon's ranking is based on executing a specific rotation, but the rotation is different for Off-Field DPS. The rotation is Tap E > N2 > Tap E > Q > Hold E (3 Stack).\nThrilling Tales Of Dragon Slayers: This option is only recommended on a low investment Lisa whereby she is focused around buffing her teammates and contributing team DPS over outputting high damage on her own.\n\nRegarding Stats Priority: These options prioritize Lisa's Elemental Burst uptime as a defense shredding tool.\n",

A shielder is required for this, with Zhongli being the most ideal option.\nSerpent Spine: At [C6] and high refinement Serpent Spine, it is better to run an ATK% Goblet over Physical Damage% with Serpent Spine. This is due to the oversaturation of damage bonuses (ascension stat + Serpent Spine) in addition to the fact that Electro accounts for a significant portion of Razor's damage. An in-depth explanation can be found here. It is also worth noting that an [R5] Serpent Spine with max stacks can outperform all 5✩ weapons at [R1].\nSkyward Pride: Skyward Pride is viable with a Physical DMG goblet, as the damage dealt through its passive scales with Physical%.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets: \nPale Flame (2) Bloodstained Chivalry (2): This set is better if your ATK% is covered by your substats, otherwise you would be better off running Gladiator's Finale (4).

When Sara uses her Elemental Skill, her next Charged Shot will leave a Crowfeather on the target location and after a short while, the Crowfeather explodes and the active character in its AoE will benefit from Sara's ATK buff, which scales with her Base ATK. \n\nAt [C2], you can skip the Charged Shot as it immediately drops a Crowfeather, and save it for later on if you wanna swap back to her to extend her buffs. You can also use Elemental Skill followed by Elemental Burst so that she benefits from the Crowfeather dropped by her Elemental Skill, then swap to other character so that character can benefit from Sara's ATK buff. It's worth mentioning that Sara's Crit DMG buff at [C6] doesn't snapshot and it also doesn't show on the stats page, so don't freak out when you don't see it there.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices: Weapons here are ranked based on their Base ATK to maximize Sara's ATK buff.\nElegy for the End: The cooldown on this weapon's passive aligns perfectly with Sara's Elemental Burst cooldown. This weapon has lower base ATK if compared with Skyward Harp, but this weapon can be considered over Skyward Harp since Sara is able to trigger the weapon passive quite easily with her Elemental Burst to provide your party members with another 100 EM and 20% ATK buff for 12 seconds, it also has Energy Recharge substat which is very valuable on a Burst Support Sara. \n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nNoblesse Oblige (4): Universal support set that is able to buff your party member's ATK by 20%, use this set on Sara if there's nobody else in the party who's equipping one.\n",

This is especially convenient on teams that doesn't conflict with her element and wants the energy provision. (i.e. Eula, Electro, National teams, etc.). Raiden has no issues with firing her ult off cooldown after reaching about 200% Energy Recharge, but it is possible to raise it higher for better energy restoration for her team.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices: This list assumes the average across a variety of buffs. \nSkyward Spine: Assumes that you are utilizing the ATK SPD buff to access higher damage combos. \nWavebreaker's Fin: [R5] Wavebreaker's Fin is relatively equal, to Staff of Homa, depending on your total team burst cost.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nTenacity of the Millelith (4): This set acts as a low investment support oriented set. Raiden is an excellent ToTM holder since her Elemental Skill has 100% uptime and procs very easily. Do note that if your Raiden is equipping this set, then she will sacrifice her personal damage.\n\nRegarding Main Stats Priority: \nRaiden's main stat priority for Sands and Goblet entirely depends on the substats, whether she has external buffs, and which weapon she is running.

[R5] Solar Pearl without buffs, or a low refine Solar Pearl with Bennett buff can perform similar to Skyward Atlas. Note that you should do a Normal Attack when you swap in and before you swap out of Yae Miko to keep good uptime on the passive.\nThe Widsith: Despite Yae's A4 bonus, the EM buff is bad. Over many rotations Widsith will be worse than equal refinement Solar Pearl regardless of buff, and can be worse than Oathsworn if you only get the EM buff. If you are trying for one rotation speedruns and are willing to reset till you get the DMG% or ATK buff, this weapon ranks much higher and can outperform the 5 stars. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the other options above Widsith for more consistent damage.\nHakushin Ring: This weapon's passive can buff your other team members, which may be more beneficial than Yae Miko's personal damage depending on the team and rotation used. Note that the passive cannot be triggered when off-field.\n\nRegarding Artifact Choices:\nEmblem of Severed Fate (4): This set works best for Yae in multi-target scenarios where her Elemental Burst hits multiple enemies. This set also provides more value if she's used WITHOUT Raiden (due to the higher ER requirements).\n+18% ATK set (2) / Thundering Fury (2) / Emblem of Severed Fate (2): Using a combination of these artifact sets works best for Yae in single-target scenarios. These also provide more value if she's paired WITH Raiden (due to lower ER requirements). \nThundersoother (4): Assuming you are able to maintain 100% uptime on its passive, this is Yae's BiS set. This set works best for Yae in Electro-charged teams.\nTenacity of the Milelith (4): This set trades off a portion of Yae's damage in return for a party wide 20 ATK% buff. If you have good pieces as a result of farming Pale Flame (for Eula or otherwise) this can be a good option for her. Not recommended to specifically farm this set for Yae.\n\nRegarding Talent Priority:  Do note that Yae's Elemental Burst does more damage than her Elemental Skill when it hits multiple enemies. \n\nBig thanks to Fob#6835 for helping us with the weapon/artifact rankings. \n",

Getting 2-3 stacks at the start of your rotation can perform better than Thundering Pulse while getting no stacks can perform worse than Skyward Harp.  This only applies if you are Vaporising Childe Burst together with Bennett. In teams without Bennett, Polar Star will always perform better than the other options. 3 stacks can be achieved by doing Skill + 1 Normal + 1 Charged Attack before setting up your Vaporise Burst. If your Skill is still on cooldown, a fully Charged Aimed shot against a riptide affected target, OR a Ranged Normal + quick Aimed shot gives 2 stacks (which can be followed by Skill for the 3rd stack).\nThundering Pulse: Slightly better than Skyward Harp depending on rotations - the more time you spend doing Normal Attacks, the more it pulls ahead over Skyward Harp, but it's not recommended to extend your Childe's melee rotation for this.\nViridescent Hunt: Offers a valuable passive that helps a lot in grouping enemies, which can offer a ton of damage from Riptide.\nBlackcliff Warbow: Due to inconsistency of gaining stacks, falls off compared to other weapons at higher refinements.\nPrototype Crescent: Requires you to trigger its passive by hitting the enemy's weak points, falls off if compared with other options without the passive triggered.\nThe Stringless: Main DPS Childe should only use this weapon in teams where you are Vaporising your Burst, as the Elemental Mastery substat loses a lot of value in other teams. If Childe is being used as a Nuke Support only for his Vaporised Burst damage, R5 Stringless will rank just below Thundering Pulse. Note that the stringless elemental skill passive does not affect Childe's melee stance auto attacks.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nHeart of Depth (2) +18% ATK set (2): This set is only about 1-2 substats behind Heart of Depth (4), you can opt out for this set instead if you already have decent pieces.\nShimenawa's Reminiscence (4): Due to this set requiring Childe to have around 140% Energy Recharge to reliably burst every rotation, it falls behind the other options.

Yelan also wants a lot of Energy Recharge to be able to maintain her Elemental Burst uptime (up to ~250 ER), this can decrease depending on the number of Hydro units or energy providers in the team.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nElegy for the End: This weapon is to be used only in reaction based comps such as Vape Hu Tao, Yelan's personal damage is lower than other options on this list, but is more beneficial for the team's damage per rotation.\nMouun's Moon: This weapon works best at [R3]+ and makes HP% Goblet potentially a stronger option instead of Hydro Bonus especially in comps with strong DMG% buffs.\n\nRegarding Artifact Main Stats:\nGoblet: HP% Goblet is to be used only if Hydro DMG% option is very bad and HP% option is very good, or if Yelan has strong DMG% buffs such as Emblem of Severed Fate (4) + Mouun's Moon (especially with refinements) or Raiden + Kazuha and so on.\n\nRegarding Talent Priority:\nNormal Attacks: Level this up only if you want to constantly use her Breakthrough Barbs.\n\nBig thanks to Vladone ツ#9281 and jstern25#1399 from Yelan Mains for helping us with the calculations.

Additionally, her first constellation greatly increases her ultimate uptime, further lowering the healing needed.\n\nAs a support, Diona's typically used for three things; Shielding, Healing, and Cryo particle generation. Pairing Diona with Cryo carries such as Ganyu and Eula allows you to funnel energy into your DPS characters while providing them with quick shields for stagger resistance. Weapons such as Sacrificial Bow and Favonius Warbow greatly increase her potential as a battery.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nSacrificial Bow: Prefered over Favonius at higher refinements for consistency and when batterying another cryo unit.\nFavonius Warbow: It is recommended to build some Crit Rate coverage to have a higher chance of triggering bow passive for energy.\nRecurve Bow: This bow will be your best choice for stronger shields, but it reduces Diona's burst uptime significantly due to having no Energy Recharge on her weapon.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nNoblesse Oblige (4): This set provides an atk buff while also increasing burst damage - this set is usually used with healers because you want to use damage sets on other support units such as Xingqiu or Beidou.\nEmblem of Severed Fate (2) Tenacity of the Milellith (2): Provides both ER and HP which are both valuable for a support diona, increasing ult uptime and healing strength respectively.\n\nRegarding Main Stats Priority: \nFull Stack HP% is recommended if you want stronger shields but a weaker heal. You can use Healing Bonus Circlet if you want a nice balance between the two. \n\nRegarding Talent Priority: \nPrioritise whichever your Diona is geared for (shielder or healer), if built for a balance between the two, level both equally.\n",

    "characterKey": "Chongyun",
    "notes": "BURST SUPPORT\nIt is preferred to use Chongyun as a Sub DPS/ Nuke over Main DPS as his Normal Attack scalings are very low, even when including Constellation 1. His Elemental Burst on the other hand hits extremely hard on later constellations and takes a much higher total damage portion over his Normal Attack. On top of that, you can Reverse Melt all 3 hits of his Elemental Burst on enemies applied with strong Pyro, such as Bennett's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.\n\nChongyun is very niche as he only performs well in certain teams and can completely destroy the other. He is mainly used on a team as an enabler, be it for Reverse Melt teams (e.g. Melt DPS Bennett) or Freeze teams (e.g. Freeze DPS Kaeya). He also does not function well with Physical teams (e.g. Razor, Eula) as it renders his Elemental Skill useless because it converts their Normal Attack damage from Physical to Cryo. They're usually using a Physical Goblet, so if they got their Normal Attack converted from Physical to Cryo, they won't benefit from Physical DMG Bonus from the goblet, thus it's a DPS loss.\n\nAt [C2], his Elemental Skill reduces ability cooldown that is casted within the zone by 15%. This is one of the few abilities in the game that can reduce cooldown.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nSerpent Spine: This weapon outperforms Wolf's Gravestone if we only look at Chongyun's damage contribution [5 Stack Assumed]. Wolf's Gravestone is ranked higher as it provides more teamwide DPS and does not come with the need to acquire stacks before engaging in combat.\nRedstone Thresher: Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.\nAkuoumaru: At [R1], Akuoumaru beats Luxurious Sea-Lord if Chongyun is used in a team with 260 or greater total team energy. Akuoumaru only beats Luxurious Sea-Lord if [R2] and above otherwise.\nSacrificial Greatsword: This weapon is your best choice if faced in a situation where you heavily rely on Chongyun's Cryo infusion uptime.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nNoblesse Oblige (4): Chongyun is one of the best Noblesse holders since he has low energy requirements for his Elemental Burst.\n\nRegarding Talent Priority: \nPrioritize Elemental Burst on a Melt team as it scales better than his Elemental Skill.\nPrioritize Elemental Skill on a Freeze team to furthermore extend the duration of the Cryo infusion.\n",

This does not mean that he should not be invested, but is still useful even without proper investments.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nFreedom Sworn: This weapon's ranking is assumed with Reverse Melt teams where the EM stat would be useful.\nSkyward Blade: In teams with a 2nd Cryo unit generating energy, this weapon would have a lower priority as the Energy Recharge stat would mostly be wasted.\nLion's Roar / The Alley Flash / Iron Sting: These weapons' rankings are assumed with Reverse Melt teams where the passive and EM stat would be useful. At [R5], these weapons would outperform Summit Shaper.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nInstructor (4): Due to his ability to easily trigger Instructor's passive, Kaeya is a good holder of Instructor (4) for Reverse Melt teams. Aside from ER%, most of his other main stats don't matter as much, making this one of his budget support builds. \nNoblesse Oblige (4): This set is only recommended if there is no other member of the team running Noblesse Oblige (4).\n",

If paired with another Cryo unit such as Chongyun or Ayaka, she will need ~130-150% Energy Recharge\nCompared to Kaeya, Rosaria has even less desire for Crit Rate, as her Ascension 1 Talent includes an extra 12% Crit Rate once skill hits the back of an enemy.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nWavebreaker's Fin: At [R5], this weapon can perform similar to Staff of Homa.\nDeathmatch: Rosaria gets a lot of Crit rate from Blizzard Strayer (4) and Cryo Resonance. As a result, this weapon falls off in value as you will tend to overcap above 100% Crit rate. If Rosaria is being used without the Blizzard Strayer (4) set, then this weapon can perform better compared to other options.\n\nRegarding Talent Priority:\nNormal Attack: If Rosaria is being used with Chongyun to infuse her normal attacks with Cryo, her Normal Attack talent will have higher priority than Skill.\n\nBURST SUPPORT\nThis section is tailored around giving Rosaria as much damage as possible. Crit Rate stacking is not as necessary, if 50% Crit Rate is guaranteed at the very least, you will still be giving crit rate buffs of 9.7% with the Ascension 1 Talent Bonus.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices: This section was calculated with 160% ER requirement, which is why ER substats weapons are valued highly here. With lower ER reqs, those weapons may fall off if compared with weapons with more offensive substats. Rosaria's [C4] can reduce this ER requirement down to 140% or lower.\nVortex Vanquisher: This ranking is assumed without a shield. With a large amount of attack buffs such as Bennett, this weapon can fall off compared to the other options due to overstacking ATK%.\nDragon's Bane / Kitain Cross Spear: These weapons are only used if Rosaria is played in a team comp in which she constantly triggers Reverse Melt. [R5] Dragon's Bane can outperform \"The Catch\", and [R5] Kitain's Cross Spear is on par with Deathmatch.\nWavebreaker's Fin: At [R5], this weapon can perform similar to Staff of Homa.\nLithic Spear: At [R5], this weapon can perform similar to Vortex Vanquisher.\nFavonius Lance: Although this weapon's damage is lower for Rosaria, the extra energy generated from the passive can be very valuable in a lot of teams that need a Cryo battery (Eula, Ayaka, etc).\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nLavawalker's Epiphany (4): Only viable on Rosaria if she's triggering Reverse Melt, pulls ahead of Noblesse Oblige (2) Blizzard Strayer (2) assuming you can trigger Reverse Melt on all of her kits.\nNoblesse Oblige (4):  Offers party-wide ATK boost, you can equip this set on Rosaria if nobody else on the team is equipping it.\n\nRegarding Substats Priority:\nElemental Mastery is only recommended if Rosaria is to be utilized as a Reverse Melt trigger, as shown in the Ability Tips section.\n\nThe following is only recommended to those who have not obtained a desirable set for Rosaria, with Crit Rate building as her placeholder set.\nIf you don't wish to hyperinvest onto Rosaria, she could still be used as a Crit Rate provider, you can build up to 88% Crit Rate and use skill to cap out 100% Crit Rate, then cast Elemental Burst for the Crit Rate buff. This can be easily achievable if you have an existing Crit Rate substat polearm, otherwise just put on whatever Crit Rate Circlet, Substats and Berserker artifacts you may have to stack Crit Rate.\n",

Charged Attack will be the majority of her damage output while neglecting her Skill/Burst damage contribution for most scenarios.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nAmos' Bow: Amos is an excellent weapon for Ganyu since her Level 2 Charge Shot Bloom extends arrow flight duration and you can get 3 stacks of Amos' passive even on point blank range.\nHamayumi: Due to its passive, this weapon prefers Wanderer's Troupe (4) instead.\nPrototype Crescent: At higher refinement levels with good uptime on its passive, it can potentially be on par with Skyward Harp. However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly. \n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nShimenawa's Reminiscence (4) and Wanderer's Troupe (4): Shimenawa's only pulls ahead if you are able to squeeze 5 Charged Attacks during the 10 second buff duration. Due to it being very difficult to do, Wanderer's Troupe (4) will usually end up dealing more damage for most players. Note that unless you intend to artifact strongbox Wanderer's Troupe pieces, Shimenawa's Riminiscence remains the better set to farm as the domain is greatly resin efficient.\n\nRegarding Talent Priority:\nGanyu's Elemental Burst is low priority on a Melt Build since most of the times, you don't cast her burst at all so that it doesn't steal your Melt reaction.\n\nFREEZE DPS\nFreeze Ganyu gives a lot of i-frames since you would be spamming Elemental Burst from all of your party members off cooldown. Ganyu's Elemental Burst can deal a ton of damage based on how grouped the enemies are, due to the quadratic scaling on her Elemental Burst.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices: \nPolar Star: This weapon is much harder to optimize with, due to having a very high Crit Rate stat resulting in your Crit Rate going well above 100%. However, if optimised properly (i.e. very little Crit Rate substats), it pulls quite far ahead of all the other options.\nAqua Simulacra: Due to the sheer amount of Crit stats you can get from Blizzard Strayer (4), Ganyu's ascension passive and this weapon itself, you can consider running an ATK% circlet, especially if it has better substats than your Crit DMG one.\nAmos' Bow: In quickswap heavy rotations (Ganyu Mona Venti Diona) where you usually don't do a lot of Charged Shots, this weapon performs worse than the other 5 star options listed.\nPrototype Crescent: Similar to the Melt Build, this weapon at higher refinement levels and good passive uptime can pull ahead of some of the 5 star options such as Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp. However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly. \n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nBlizzard Strayer (4): This set is the go to set for a Frozen team comp due to the huge stats it provides.\n\nOFF-FIELD DPS\nAn Off-field DPS Ganyu shines brightly on a Freeze comp as she has 100% Elemental Burst uptime and her Elemental Burst buffs party members' Cryo Damage. \n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nPrototype Crescent: This weapon might pull ahead of some of the other options if you activate the buff before casting Elemental Burst.\nElegy for the End: Offers party-wide Elemental Mastery and ATK buff which is quite nice on reaction heavy team comps.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nBlizzard Strayer (4): This set offers a huge amount of stats, use this set only if your Ganyu is used on a Freeze team.\nNoblesse Oblige (4): This set provides Ganyu with more utility so that she can buff your whole party's ATK by 20%.\n",

If you are able to sustain the conditional buff, you will be able to achieve a 50% Physical DMG Bonus + 18% ATK.

She has a special dash (like Mona) and after she dashes, she will get a Cryo infusion on her Normal Attacks. Ensure you always have this bonus active to maximise your rotation damage.\n\nRegarding Main Stats Priority:\nCirclet main stat will be dependant on your overall stats, depending on your overall stats, one can be better than the other. Since Ayaka is able to get a lot of Crit Value from Blizzard Strayer (4) set, ascension passive, and also possibly weapons, ATK circlets can be competitive to Crit ones, it also has a better drop rate, so don't throw away your good ATK circlets.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nPrimordial Jade Cutter: With Blizzard Strayer (4) and Cryo Resonance, this weapon overcrits, so try to avoid getting Crit Rate substats.\nAquila Favonia: While Aquila has Physical Damage% as a main stat, which is basically useless on Ayaka, it is still a good statstick as it has a high base ATK and ATK% buff from the passive, however, it's not a huge upgrade over the other 4 star options and there might be a character which can utilize this weapon better (such as Bennett).\nSkyward Blade: The Energy Recharge main stat provided from this sword makes Ayaka comfortable in terms of having a good burst uptime, try to avoid getting Energy Recharge substats since the weapon already provides you with enough Energy Recharge.\nAmenoma Kageuchi: Lowers Ayaka's Energy Recharge requirement which allows her to allocate some of her Energy Recharge substats to other offensive substats. This weapon is also free and craftable while being competitive with other 4 star and even some 5 star weapons as well on the list.\nBlackcliff Longsword: Due to Ayaka's burst snapshotting, her burst is unable to benefit from the ATK buff from this weapon's passive on the first rotation (since you cast it immediately before defeating an opponent).\nHarbinger of Dawn: A good Crit statstick if you can keep the requirements up (having >90% HP).\n",

One thing to note regarding Aloy's coil stacks is that she can still get coil stacks even when she's off-field.\n\nAloy is very niche as she only performs well in certain comps and even then, she's still completely replaceable by other characters. She can be utilized on a Freeze team where she can be a battery and nuke at the same time since she provides 5 Cryo particles on her Elemental Skill. She can also be utilized on a Melt team where you can melt her Elemental Burst for quite a decent amount of damage.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choice:\nPolar Star: Forcing to get Polar stacks isn't worth due to consuming extra time to get those stacks.\nThe Stringless: Placement was considering Aloy is used on a Reverse Melt team. On Reverse Melt Aloy, Stringless especially at higher refinement levels can pull ahead of Thundering Pulse.\nPrototype Crescent: Assumes the passive is active by proccing a weak point shot.

As such, at higher refines / more stacks on the passive, this weapon can perform better than Skyward Blade, while at lower refines / less stacks, it can perform worse.\nFreedom-Sworn: The ranking here only assumes Jean's personal damage and not the utility it gives. If you want to furthermore buff your main DPS, you can give this sword to Jean as she can trigger Freedom-Sworn's skill relatively easily since Anemo is always trigger. \nLion's Roar: Depending on passive uptime, it can be ranked over Favonius Sword (at 50% uptime) and even Aquila Favonia (at 100% uptime).\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nViridescent Venerer (4): The bread and butter for Anemo characters in general, as it is commonly used for the 40% elemental resistance shred.\nNoblesse Oblige (4): Another ther option for providing utilities to the team. This set gives a 20% partywide ATK boost after Jean casts her Elemental Burst.\nOcean-Hued Clam (4): The best set for Jean's personal damage, as the damage it deals scales with Jean's burst healing. However, because Jean's total damage output is on the low end, it is generally recommended to prioritize utility options such as Noblesse Oblige or Viridescent Venerer over this set.\n\nRegarding Main Stats Priority:\nElemental Mastery should only be used when Jean is paired with Bennett, as her burst ticks will swirl the self applied Pyro from Bennett's burst, acting as a damage source and Pyro application. Because of this, high burst uptime is required and so weapons with EM and ER passives are preferred. (Freedom Sworn, Skyward Blade,  Favonius Sword, Sacrificial Sword, Iron Sting, Amenoma Kageuchi)\n\nRegarding Talent Priorities: \nIf you prefer more damage than healing, prioritize Elemental Skill over Elemental Burst since it scales better.\nFor Support Jean, you can either go for more ATK for stronger heals, but relatively lower Burst uptime, or more ER for lower heals, but higher Burst uptime. Choosing between these two is up to personal preference, although if another Anemo character is on the team, Jean has very little energy problem and can potentially go full Sub DPS build.",

Because of this, an ADC (Attack/Damage/Crit) build isn't recommended unless he is in a team whereby he cannot make use of his A4 passive or swirls.

This teams includes an off-field Hydro and Electro support to allow Kazuha to constantly trigger the 4p effect and spam his Elemental Skill, aswell as another Anemo support to hold the 4p Viridiscent Venerer set. Such teams can be Kazuha + Kokomi + Fischl + Venti, with Barbara and Sucrose being weaker replacements for Kokomi and Venti.

Comfort option that can lose to a high refined Whiteblind with stacks.\nFavonius Greatsword: Only recommended with high refines, as its usefulness scales with its particle generation capabilities. R5 allows her to self-battery assuming some additional particles from enemies, but a second Geo is always recommended regardless for resonance. \n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nHusk of Opulent Dreams (4): Noelle snapshots her DEF on burst cast. To get the full 4 stacks' DEF% boost during your first burst, you need to wait 12 seconds off field before swapping in. In abyss, time spent before the chamber starts still generates stacks.\nRetracing Bolide (4): Optimally offers slightly less damage than Gladiator's, but is much easier to farm per resin and can have 100% uptime with crystallise shields. Consider Gladiator's Finale if you don't want to farm for Archaic Petra as Artifact Strongbox is much more effective than elite bosses in terms of artifacts per resin.\n\nSUPPORT\nSupport Noelle is not currently recommended in any content due to her extremely lackluster healing and poor shield uptime.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nSacrificial Greatsword: Does not proc on Noelle's [C4] if she's off field, so a high refine is needed for the initial cast to reliably reset cooldown. Even with [R5], the cooldown is 16 seconds while Noelle's shield duration is 12, so forced downtime is an issue.\nFavonius Greatsword: Relies on hitting crits to generate energy. The 12 second cooldown at [R1] matches with her shield cooldown. Generally not recommended unless you have an abundance of crit substats or wish to build her pseudo-DPS.\n",

    "notes": "SUPPORT\nGorou is a Support character that can give increasing buffs to your party members from his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst based on the number of Geo characters in your team (capped at 3). Casting his Elemental Skill sets up a banner which gives flat DEF (1 Geo), Interruption Resistance (2 Geo) and Geo DMG% Bonus (3 Geo) for your active character standing inside the banner radius. Casting his Elemental Burst creates a field following the active character which deals periodic damage and offers the same bonuses given by the Skill, destroying any placed banners in the process, it also pulls in nearby Elemental Shards created by Crystallize reactions. Due to his kit focusing on buffing DEF and Geo DMG, he's a specialised support geared towards Geo DPS that scales with DEF, such as Noelle or Itto. He can see niche use at [C6] with other Geo characters as well.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nElegy for the End: Elegy offers a helpful ER substat alongside an EM and ATK% buff for your teammates. While not directly useful in teams centered around Noelle or Itto, this could possibly be a good choice for future Geo DPS characters, or in a team which utilizes Geo Resonance.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nThe Exile (4): Casting Elemental Burst regenerates a total of 6 Energy for each of your party member. This set reduces your Energy Requirements by a bit for all of your party members, which can be quite beneficial. Do note that this is a 4 star set so you're potentially missing out on 5 star stat scaling, which is a 34% difference in mainstat value and 25% difference in individual substat value.\nNoblesse Oblige (4): The effectiveness of this set increases if you've already met the ER requirement for Gorou. At that point, you'd no longer need to run the recommended ER% sets, which means you can opt for this instead. \n\nRegarding Artifact Mainstats and Substats Priority:\nDEF% mainstats and substats (and potentially a Healing Bonus mainstat on Circlet) can be considered at [C4] due to being able to heal the active character based on his DEF during burst. This is useful if you plan to use him as a solo healer.\nCrit Rate circlet and substats can be considered when Gorou is using Favonius Warbow to trigger the passive comfortably.\nER% substats can usually be more important than getting the right mainstat, as Gorou's damage contribution to a team is negligible, while being able to get Energy for his Burst is a lot more important.\n",

This means that external DEF buffs like from Gorou's Elemental Skill and/or Burst doesn't provide much to Yun Jin since it only buffs active characters and not off-field ones.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nFavonius Lance: With this weapon, try to aim for some Crit Rate stats to trigger the weapon passive reliably.\nKitain Cross Spear: Although the EM mainstat isn't useful for Yun Jin, the passive decreases her Energy Recharge requirements by a lot, especially at higher refinements. It can reduce her ER% reqs from around ~20% at R1 to ~70% at R5. Note that she must cast Elemental Burst first before Skill, as the passive drains 3 energy initially when Skill is cast.

Prioritize HP scaling polearms such as Black Tassel and artifact sets such as Tenacity of the Millelith (4) to capitalize on Zhongli's Shield. Most of the time, especially on a HP-focused Zhongli, casting Elemental Burst is a DPS loss due to the cast time, which is why you'd only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it offers, and not for damage.\n\nNote that if paired with Xingqiu and/or Beidou, the damage reduction from orbitals from Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst and/or Beidou's Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli's shield, making it basically unbreakable.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nFavonius Lance: Use this weapon over Black Tassel if you value the team energy (Note that you need to build some amount of Crit Rate if you are running Favonius Lance to trigger the passive).\n\nBURST SUPPORT\nZhongli can be utilized as a Geo Burst damage dealer due to his short Elemental Burst cooldown (12s) and low energy cost (40 Energy). His Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales with HP and at Ascension 4, you would unlock a talent that allows your Elemental Burst to scale with 33% of Zhongli's Max HP, making him a great source of Shield and damage.\n\nRegarding Artifact Main Stats:\nATK sands provides more damage than HP sands, but it does have lesser Shield HP. If you want more Shield HP, you can consider running a HP sands.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nNoblesse Oblige (2) Archaic Petra (2): On lower ER requirements where Zhongli doesn't need to worry about his energy needs, this set pulls ahead of Emblem of Severed Fate (4).\nNoblesse Oblige (4): This set provides Zhongli more utility when casting his Elemental Burst, you can use this set on Zhongli if there is nobody else on the team who's equipping this set.\nTenacity of the Millelith (4): Just like Noblesse Oblige (4), this set provides Zhongli with more utility if his Elemental Skill hits an enemy.

    "characterKey": "Albedo",
    "notes": "OFF-FIELD DPS\nAlbedo is a character that can summon a Geo Construct from his Elemental Skill which deals damage on a 2 second interval whenever enemies in the field are damaged. His Elemental Burst provides 125 EM to the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn't benefit from the 125 EM buff. Another option is to build him with ATK-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher Burst damage.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nHarbinger of Dawn: Albedo's Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Base ATK from the weapon doesn't matter that much. Harbinger of Dawn offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you'd need to keep Albedo's HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.\nMistsplitter Reforged: Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon's passive and this requires setup. Generally just use Harbinger of Dawn instead and give your Mistsplitter Reforged to another sword DPS character.\nFreedom-Sworn: Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo's own damage significantly but he is one of the better Freedom-Sworn holders since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other party members.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nHusk of Opulent Dreams (4): Due to Albedo's skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait ~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF and Geo DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.\nTenacity of the Milelith (4): This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.\nNoblesse Oblige (4): If you don't have another character in your party that has this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst uptime for this. It is also worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.\n\nRegarding Artifact Substats Priority:\nATK and Energy Recharge substats are only valuable on a Hybrid Albedo that casts his Elemental Burst.\n",

His combos involve stacking and unleashing his Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesigiri consumes no stamina and can be casted continuously as long as he has Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is capped at 5 stacks at any given time, and Itto gets those stacks when his 2nd and 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy. Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st and 3rd Normal Attack to also generate stacks. Itto's Elemental Skill deals damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1 Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field, Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto's Elemental Burst converts his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo DMG, increases Itto's Normal Attack Speed and converts a portion of Itto's current DEF to ATK.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nSerpent Spine: When using Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of the Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).\nSkyward Pride: Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your ER needs. The less Energy Recharge you need (due to particle generation from your party members or ER from subs), the less useful this weapon becomes.\nWhiteblind: Your rotations often start with 1 stack of this weapon, and due to Itto's Burst snapshotting DEF on cast, you're unable to take advantage of further DEF% from the stacks.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets: \nRetracting Bolide (4): Bolide grants you an additional 40% Normal and Charged Attack DMG when shielded.
