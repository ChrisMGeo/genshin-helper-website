This is useful if you plan to use him as a solo healer.\\nCrit Rate circlet and substats can be considered when Gorou is using Favonius Warbow to trigger the passive comfortably.\\nER% substats can usually be more important than getting the right mainstat, as Gorou\'s damage contribution to a team is negligible, while being able to get Energy for his Burst is a lot more important.\\n","builds":[{"name":"SUPPORT \u2729","weapons":[],"artifactSets":[],"artifactMainStats":"Sands - Energy Recharge\\nGoblet - Geo DMG / DEF%*\\nCirclet - Crit Rate / DEF%* / Healing Bonus*","artifactSubStats":"1.

This allows his teammates to gain the 3 Geo 15% Geo DMG% bonus for a longer duration, so it\'s preferable to use Burst as your last ability before swapping into your DPS.

Yun Jin\'s Elemental Burst grants nearby party members 30 stacks of additional flat damage bonus on Normal Attacks which scales with Yun Jin\'s current DEF. This means that external DEF buffs like from Gorou\'s Elemental Skill and/or Burst doesn\'t provide much to Yun Jin since it only buffs active characters and not off-field ones.\\n\\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\\nFavonius Lance: With this weapon, try to aim for some Crit Rate stats to trigger the weapon passive reliably.\\nKitain Cross Spear: Although the EM mainstat isn\'t useful for Yun Jin, the passive decreases her Energy Recharge requirements by a lot, especially at higher refinements. It can reduce her ER% reqs from around ~20% at R1 to ~70% at R5. Note that she must cast Elemental Burst first before Skill, as the passive drains 3 energy initially when Skill is cast.

Prioritize HP scaling polearms such as Black Tassel and artifact sets such as Tenacity of the Millelith (4) to capitalize on Zhongli\'s Shield. Most of the time, especially on a HP-focused Zhongli, casting Elemental Burst is a DPS loss due to the cast time, which is why you\'d only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it offers, and not for damage.\\n\\nNote that if paired with Xingqiu and/or Beidou, the damage reduction from orbitals from Xingqiu\'s Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst and/or Beidou\'s Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli\'s shield, making it basically unbreakable.\\n\\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\\nFavonius Lance: Use this weapon over Black Tassel if you value the team energy (Note that you need to build some amount of Crit Rate if you are running Favonius Lance to trigger the passive).\\n\\nBURST SUPPORT\\nZhongli can be utilized as a Geo Burst damage dealer due to his short Elemental Burst cooldown (12s) and low energy cost (40 Energy). His Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales with HP and at Ascension 4, you would unlock a talent that allows your Elemental Burst to scale with 33% of Zhongli\'s Max HP, making him a great source of Shield and damage.\\n\\nRegarding Artifact Main Stats:\\nATK sands provides more damage than HP sands, but it does have lesser Shield HP. If you want more Shield HP, you can consider running a HP sands.\\n\\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\\nNoblesse Oblige (2) Archaic Petra (2): On lower ER requirements where Zhongli doesn\'t need to worry about his energy needs, this set pulls ahead of Emblem of Severed Fate (4).\\nNoblesse Oblige (4): This set provides Zhongli more utility when casting his Elemental Burst, you can use this set on Zhongli if there is nobody else on the team who\'s equipping this set.\\nTenacity of the Millelith (4): Just like Noblesse Oblige (4), this set provides Zhongli with more utility if his Elemental Skill hits an enemy.

His Elemental Burst provides 125 EM to the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn\'t benefit from the 125 EM buff. Another option is to build him with ATK-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher Burst damage.\\n\\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\\nHarbinger of Dawn: Albedo\'s Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Base ATK from the weapon doesn\'t matter that much. Harbinger of Dawn offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you\'d need to keep Albedo\'s HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.\\nMistsplitter Reforged: Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon\'s passive and this requires setup. Generally just use Harbinger of Dawn instead and give your Mistsplitter Reforged to another sword DPS character.\\nFreedom-Sworn: Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo\'s own damage significantly but he is one of the better Freedom-Sworn holders since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other party members.\\n\\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\\nHusk of Opulent Dreams (4): Due to Albedo\'s skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait ~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF and Geo DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.\\nTenacity of the Milelith (4): This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.\\nNoblesse Oblige (4): If you don\'t have another character in your party that has this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst uptime for this.

His combos involve stacking and unleashing his Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesigiri consumes no stamina and can be casted continuously as long as he has Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is capped at 5 stacks at any given time, and Itto gets those stacks when his 2nd and 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy. Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st and 3rd Normal Attack to also generate stacks. Itto\'s Elemental Skill deals damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1 Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field, Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto\'s Elemental Burst converts his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo DMG, increases Itto\'s Normal Attack Speed and converts a portion of Itto\'s current DEF to ATK.\\n\\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\\nSerpent Spine: When using Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of the Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).\\nSkyward Pride: Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your ER needs. The less Energy Recharge you need (due to particle generation from your party members or ER from subs), the less useful this weapon becomes.\\nWhiteblind: Your rotations often start with 1 stack of this weapon, and due to Itto\'s Burst snapshotting DEF on cast, you\'re unable to take advantage of further DEF% from the stacks.\\n\\nRegarding Artifact Sets: \\nRetracting Bolide (4): Bolide grants you an additional 40% Normal and Charged Attack DMG when shielded.
