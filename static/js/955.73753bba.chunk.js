The combo for the highest Melt/Vaporize damage is The Black Sword and EM sand. [R1] Iron Sting and EM sand turns out to have diminishing returns and isn\'t as good, but [R2+] Iron Sting is a different question because better buffs. (Assuming you don\'t have a whale build\'s CR/CD stats, in which case Aquila with EM sands is just flat out better.)\\n\\nThundering Fury (4): This set works best if paired with Electro supports such as Beidou and Fischl/Lisa, as it allows Bennett to accomplish 2 things: \\n1) Rapidly spam E for raw pyro damage + overload\\n2) Generate tons of energy for the entire team. \\nThundering Fury (4) also allows Bennett to quickly break the shields of the Abyss Lectors in the Spiral Abyss. This comp is generally only recommended for those with Beidou on C2/C6.\\nIt\'s worth noting that the main-stat artifacts you want to farm for 4-TF Bennett varies from the main-stat artifacts you\'d normally go for in other builds. Instead of ATK/EM, Pyro, and Crit, you\'d instead want to go for EM/Pyro/EM on a 4-TF Bennett. As such, this also means weapons that have EM substats such as Iron sting take priority over other swords. \\n\\nIt is also worth noting that with 4 TF, Primordial Jade Cutter is able to overtake MIstsplitter Reforged due to its massive Crit Rate% substat, which allows you to vape consistently despite the lack of Crit Dmg/Crit Rate subs in your artifacts. This assumes that your EM mainstat pieces (sands, goblet, and circlet) lack Crit Rate substats. However, in the rare occasion that your EM pieces manage to roll plenty of Crit subs, Mistsplitter easily overtakes Jade Cutter.\\nRecommended amount of ER%: 130-150%. Worth noting that with Thundering Fury (4), you have a lot more leeway when it comes to ER.\\n\\nBURST SUPPORT\\nA Burst Support Bennett completely ignores the need for excess healing potential and is aimed for people who prefer to squeeze out more damage instead. \\nOn this build, Bennett is built with offensive stats like ATK%, Pyro Damage, and Crit stats while having a good amount of Energy Recharge to burst off cooldown. \\nPrioritize Energy Recharge before offensive stats if you cannot cast your Elemental Burst off cooldown.\\n\\nSUPPORT\\nHeals from his Elemental Burst scale off of HP, while his damage buff from Burst only scales with your base ATK (Character Base ATK stat and Weapon Base ATK stat)\\nDO NOT increase Bennett\'s constellation from 5 to 6 unless he is in a Pyro team and you know what you\'re doing. This is because Bennett turns all of your melee on-field character\'s Auto Attacks into Pyro, which means that Bennett will lose a lot of his team comp potential.\\nAlthough Bennett is usually considered a healer, he already heals a lot even without necessarily building for HP%, if you find it unnecessary to build for HP%, you can consider building him as a Sub DPS.\\n\\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\\nMistsplitter Reforged, Aquila Favonia: These weapons have the highest Base ATK in the game which is why it is ranked quite high. It is assuming you have enough Energy Recharge so you still can burst off cooldown for the maximum ATK buff.\\nFreedom-Sworn: In comps where Bennett can reliably trigger reactions (and thus trigger this sword\'s passive), the buffs provided by this weapon will be stronger than Aquila Favonia.\\nThe Alley Flash: This weapon currently has the highest Base ATK for a 4 star weapon (even more Base ATK than some 5 stars like Skyward Blade).\\nPrototype Rancour: This weapon has one of the highest Base ATK for a 4 Star weapon (and this is also a weapon you could craft from the Blacksmith)\\n","builds":[{"name":"DPS","weapons":"1.

If you want to use her as a Physical Support, she needs both her Ascension 4 Talent and [C4] to maximize her support capabilities, making her a somewhat expensive choice to be considered for Physical Support role. However, the Tenacity of the Millelith set gives her a new role with a lower Constellation level prerequisite.\\n\\nTenacity of the Millelith: This set gives Xinyan a unique role among the shielders. Currently, Xinyan is one of the few shielders in the game who can make full use of the Tenacity set\'s effects.

Vaporize is generally the more consistent option and you need Xingqiu to make this work best.

It is not recommended to buy this weapon specifically for Hu Tao and should only be used if you already have one.\\nVortex Vanquisher and Skyward Spine: Provides little to nothing to Hu Tao since she scales better with HP% than ATK% with every spear in the game.

Getting 2-3 stacks at the start of your rotation can perform better than Thundering Pulse while getting no stacks can perform worse than Skyward Harp.  This only applies if you are Vaporising Childe Burst together with Bennett. In teams without Bennett, Polar Star will always perform better than the other options. 3 stacks can be achieved by doing Skill + 1 Normal + 1 Charged Attack before setting up your Vaporise Burst. If your Skill is still on cooldown, a fully Charged Aimed shot against a riptide affected target, OR a Ranged Normal + quick Aimed shot gives 2 stacks (which can be followed by Skill for the 3rd stack).\\nThundering Pulse: Slightly better than Skyward Harp depending on rotations - the more time you spend doing Normal Attacks, the more it pulls ahead over Skyward Harp, but it\'s not recommended to extend your Childe\'s melee rotation for this.\\nViridescent Hunt: Offers a valuable passive that helps a lot in grouping enemies, which can offer a ton of damage from Riptide.\\nBlackcliff Warbow: Due to inconsistency of gaining stacks, falls off compared to other weapons at higher refinements.\\nPrototype Crescent: Requires you to trigger its passive by hitting the enemy\'s weak points, falls off if compared with other options without the passive triggered.\\nThe Stringless: Main DPS Childe should only use this weapon in teams where you are Vaporising your Burst, as the Elemental Mastery substat loses a lot of value in other teams. If Childe is being used as a Nuke Support only for his Vaporised Burst damage, R5 Stringless will rank just below Thundering Pulse. Note that the stringless elemental skill passive does not affect Childe\'s melee stance auto attacks.\\n\\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\\nHeart of Depth (2) +18% ATK set (2): This set is only about 1-2 substats behind Heart of Depth (4), you can opt out for this set instead if you already have decent pieces.\\nShimenawa\'s Reminiscence (4): Due to this set requiring Childe to have around 140% Energy Recharge to reliably burst every rotation, it falls behind the other options.

His Elemental Burst on the other hand hits extremely hard on later constellations and takes a much higher total damage portion over his Normal Attack. On top of that, you can Reverse Melt all 3 hits of his Elemental Burst on enemies applied with strong Pyro, such as Bennett\'s Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.\\n\\nChongyun is very niche as he only performs well in certain teams and can completely destroy the other. He is mainly used on a team as an enabler, be it for Reverse Melt teams (e.g. Melt DPS Bennett) or Freeze teams (e.g. Freeze DPS Kaeya). He also does not function well with Physical teams (e.g. Razor, Eula) as it renders his Elemental Skill useless because it converts their Normal Attack damage from Physical to Cryo. They\'re usually using a Physical Goblet, so if they got their Normal Attack converted from Physical to Cryo, they won\'t benefit from Physical DMG Bonus from the goblet, thus it\'s a DPS loss.\\n\\nAt [C2], his Elemental Skill reduces ability cooldown that is casted within the zone by 15%. This is one of the few abilities in the game that can reduce cooldown.\\n\\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\\nSerpent Spine: This weapon outperforms Wolf\'s Gravestone if we only look at Chongyun\'s damage contribution [5 Stack Assumed]. Wolf\'s Gravestone is ranked higher as it provides more teamwide DPS and does not come with the need to acquire stacks before engaging in combat.\\nRedstone Thresher: Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you\'re getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf\'s Gravestone in personal damage.\\nAkuoumaru: At [R1], Akuoumaru beats Luxurious Sea-Lord if Chongyun is used in a team with 260 or greater total team energy.

If you are able to sustain the conditional buff, you will be able to achieve a 50% Physical DMG Bonus + 18% ATK. Without using your Elemental Burst, you can sustain the Pale Flame\'s 4 piece set bonus because each stack lasts 7s and it refreshes per stack, and Eula\'s Elemental Skill cooldown is only 4 seconds when doing 1-taps, therefore you can keep the condition up. When using this set, it is recommended to not use Hold Skill cast until your Lightfall Sword is nearly about to end. This restriction is only for players who don\'t have Eula [C2+]. Please visit the Ability Tips for her combo.\\nPale Flame (2) Bloodstained Chivalry (2): This is a non-conditional, consistent artifact set that provides you a constant 50% Physical DMG bonus.

His Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales with HP and at Ascension 4, you would unlock a talent that allows your Elemental Burst to scale with 33% of Zhongli\'s Max HP, making him a great source of Shield and damage.\\n\\nRegarding Artifact Main Stats:\\nATK sands provides more damage than HP sands, but it does have lesser Shield HP. If you want more Shield HP, you can consider running a HP sands.\\n\\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\\nNoblesse Oblige (2) Archaic Petra (2): On lower ER requirements where Zhongli doesn\'t need to worry about his energy needs, this set pulls ahead of Emblem of Severed Fate (4).\\nNoblesse Oblige (4): This set provides Zhongli more utility when casting his Elemental Burst, you can use this set on Zhongli if there is nobody else on the team who\'s equipping this set.\\nTenacity of the Millelith (4): Just like Noblesse Oblige (4), this set provides Zhongli with more utility if his Elemental Skill hits an enemy. This set also provides Zhongli with stronger shields.\\n","builds":[{"name":"PHYSICAL DPS","weapons":"1. Crescent Pike (4\u2729)\\n2. Primordial Jade Winged-Spear (5\u2729)\\n3.

His Elemental Burst provides 125 EM to the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn\'t benefit from the 125 EM buff. Another option is to build him with ATK-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher Burst damage.\\n\\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\\nHarbinger of Dawn: Albedo\'s Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Base ATK from the weapon doesn\'t matter that much. Harbinger of Dawn offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you\'d need to keep Albedo\'s HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.\\nMistsplitter Reforged: Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon\'s passive and this requires setup. Generally just use Harbinger of Dawn instead and give your Mistsplitter Reforged to another sword DPS character.\\nFreedom-Sworn: Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo\'s own damage significantly but he is one of the better Freedom-Sworn holders since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other party members.\\n\\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\\nHusk of Opulent Dreams (4): Due to Albedo\'s skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait ~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF and Geo DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.\\nTenacity of the Milelith (4): This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.\\nNoblesse Oblige (4): If you don\'t have another character in your party that has this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst uptime for this. It is also worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.\\n\\nRegarding Artifact Substats Priority:\\nATK and Energy Recharge substats are only valuable on a Hybrid Albedo that casts his Elemental Burst.\\n","builds":[{"name":"OFF-FIELD DPS \u2729","weapons":"1.

His combos involve stacking and unleashing his Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesigiri consumes no stamina and can be casted continuously as long as he has Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is capped at 5 stacks at any given time, and Itto gets those stacks when his 2nd and 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy. Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st and 3rd Normal Attack to also generate stacks. Itto\'s Elemental Skill deals damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1 Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field, Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto\'s Elemental Burst converts his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo DMG, increases Itto\'s Normal Attack Speed and converts a portion of Itto\'s current DEF to ATK.\\n\\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\\nSerpent Spine: When using Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of the Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).\\nSkyward Pride: Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your ER needs. The less Energy Recharge you need (due to particle generation from your party members or ER from subs), the less useful this weapon becomes.\\nWhiteblind: Your rotations often start with 1 stack of this weapon, and due to Itto\'s Burst snapshotting DEF on cast, you\'re unable to take advantage of further DEF% from the stacks.\\n\\nRegarding Artifact Sets: \\nRetracting Bolide (4): Bolide grants you an additional 40% Normal and Charged Attack DMG when shielded.
